<text>Welcome to the heavy cargo lifter aircraft Antonow 225 Mrija Version 5.0.2

Autostart: press s and make the 2 additional settings!

Manual start up:

- Set throttles to "IDLE" position
- Overhead panel: Main and Help Batteries and Inverter
- Switch on Generators
- Middle top panel: Switch on Beacons, NAV and Instrument lights
- Overhead panel: Switch on all Radio and Navigation Instruments and the Transponder
- Bottom middle panel: round knob for fuel in any right position - activates the tanks and pumps, a green lamp shows up.
- Switch on all 4 Ignitions
- Push starter buttons and wait for each engine 17 seconds to spool up
- Switch on taxi-light
- Engineer panel: check red lamps going to green, then engines are ready to go, move throttle to idle position.
- Check cargo and/or payload: press y to switch to the ramp control and open the red box, for loading cargo.

Additional Settings:

1. Reference Compass at engineer panel, magnetic variation is shown as tooltip, set needle to marker position.
2. Altitude and/or pressure settings in the Altimeters in inHG, mmHG or hPa (as tooltip), the Autopilot will work with this values (not with the HUD-infos).

Shut down: Fuel knob to left position or engine starter switches down.

Failure training: you may shut down 1 to 3 engines during flight and try to land in emergency situation.

Some instruments will show you metric values, some ft/knots.

There is a 3 knob panel at the left side, marker volume, instrument lights and for rembrandt - cabin lights.

The switch right from the Lights panel is for landing and taxi lights.
Then there is the switch for activating the cargo door.
And a switch for the new ALS lights, they are working only without Rembrandt and also not over the MP-modus.

On the very left side you have a panel with 5 green lamps, the lower 3 are for trim-neutralisation, used after the Autopilot is dissabled.
The upper two you may press to get the latest METAR infos on screen.

Reverser initialisation by the switch at the throttle or key "Delete", a red lamp shows the activ reverser. Also a placecard "R" is comming up
at top of the panel, the switch and the placecard can be used to deactivate the reverser. Any throttle change activates/deactivates the reverser then.

The Autopilot Helper panel in the top middle console is fully working.You may use some instruments to put in the values:
- Heading Control: Heading Bug (HDG) and Course of ILS (NAV) are to set in the HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator (with 4 green markers),
- Velocity Control: Speed with Throttle are set in the Speed Indicator, push IAS and turn needle (left from HSI)
- Pitch/Attitude Control is working if you get the plane in a climbing or descending position and push the Button VS, pitch wheel changes values.
- Wing leveler is activ when you push the AP button, it is also the AP activating/deactivating Button,
- APRP is used for intersepting the Glide Scope,
- GPS for flying routes from the Route Manager,
- ALT is holding your attitude.

For ILS Landing you may use the HSI, it gives you the indication that ILS and/or Glide Scope is intersepted (if not, red flags comming up).
ILS heading works even far out the stream, for the glidscope you should wait till the indicator is in nearly horizontal position (yellow line).

Flaps Controll Panel will give you the right level for slats (on the right side) and flaps (on the left side), if the white strips are in the
middle position with normal cargo.

Trails are now working only above 14000 ft, on ground it is not realistic.

There are 3 Altimeters: the left one is electrical and gets the information from Radio or GPS signals, in meter and mmHG,
the upper one is in meter and mmHG, a tooltip shows you the Value in hPa, the lower one is in ft and inHG,
they are connected and you should set them to the ATIS information of the airport befor starting or landing.

The compasses are cleared of the magnetic variation if you set the reference compass in the engineer panel to the orange marker position.

On top of the horizontal heading indicator (HSI) there are indicators for fuel low (below 2500 l),over speed warning, over-loading, parking brake,
outer, middle and inner marker, brake-chokes, decission hight and reverser.

There is a warning light for overload on top of the compasses (sign: BEC).

Radios, DMEs, ADFs and Kurs (ILS) Instruments are fully working and can be set in the Engineer-Panel.

Liveries by eagle, for full effect: view-graphic options-shader options: model to higher position

Rembrandt ready! Also everything is working fine without Rembrandt. ALS lights are also implemented.

Have fun and get the latest version at:
github.com/HerbyW
Maximal Speed:                459 kn = 850 km/h
Empty weight:              385808 lb = 175.000 kg
Maximal payload:           551155 lb = 250.000 kg
Max take off weight is: 1,322,773 lb = 600.000 kg

Shuttle doors should be closed befor take off, payload for Shuttle is set by loading it with the switch at the panel.

7 steps of flaps, 4 steps of slats, 4 steps of spoilers, landing speed is about 150 kt.
Flying with empty cargo may be very tricky!

Have fun!
